**Bussiness Insights**

•	Netflix has majority of content released after 2018 .It is seen content for earlier years is less and hence could not engage senior citizens.IT can try and engage senior citizen by targeting senior citizen audience .
•	As we saw earlier, Maximum content is of TV-MA , TV-14 or PG and R . Which means 80% of content is either for adult or for children with parental control options.It could target on TV-G and for younger childrens who could be engaged in future .
•	Most of the Genre in  Netflix is international movies and shows .We can increase audience engagement by more and more preferred genre in particular country .
•	Only top 10 countries contribute to the 70 % of Netflix content and rest comes for remaining countries hence Netflix could engage more and more countries to increase business and relatable audience
•	Even We could consider the duration of shows and Movies and work in accordance with it for upcoming shows and seasons .As we saw maximum viewers like watching movies having one seasons or with minimum number of time frame .
•	Consider what competitors are producing and identify gaps or opportunities where Netflix can differentiate itself from .
•	Netflix Should Focus more on producing movies along with Tv Shows according to the what we have seen  from  the given data

**Recommendations**


•	Very limited Genre has been Focused in other countries except United States .Hence every country area should try and add their cultural instinct to it and engage more audience through it .Determine the regional preferences for particular genre and type of content and particular target audience .

•	Collaborate with local content creator, Producers and distributors to strengthen the market
•	Try and release more and more original and something new story targeting on different audience groups and keep the waiting period short as now people keep searching new contents more and more.
•	Netflix Should Focus more on producing movies considering all kinds of ratings and delivering high quality content to audience.`
